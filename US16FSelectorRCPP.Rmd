# Load required packages
```{r}
require(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(FSelector)
library(FSelectorRcpp)
library(ElemStatLearn)
#library(corrplot)
```

# Load data
```{r}
fcpp <- read.csv("C:/Users/YENN/Desktop/UST/FARS2016N/accident2016.csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)
```


# Merge YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE into Timestamps 
```{r}
fcpp$TIMESTAMP <- with(fcpp, ISOdatetime(YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, sec = 0, tz=""))
```

# Remove TWAY_ID2 attribute, the only variable with missing values: <sum(is.na (accs$TWAY_ID2))> and TWAY_ID, not appropiate for the research project
# Remove YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE attributes - it's been merged into Timestamps 12:14
# Remove WEATHER1, WEATHER2 attributes, are duplicate of the original WEATHER
# Remove RAIL attribute, no relevant to the research

## accs2016 <- accs[,-c(1:2,10:11,12:14,16:17,23:24,37:38,41)]
```{r}
fcpp16 <- fcpp[,-c(1:2,10:14,16:17,23:24,37:38,41,53)]
```

# Values of the FATALS attributes
```{r}
table(fcpp16$FATALS)
```


```{r}
fcpp16$FATALS <- mapvalues(fcpp16$FATALS, from = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "9"), to = c(0,1,1,1,1,1,1))

table(fcpp16$FATALS)
```
The above result shows imbalanced data.

```{r}
fcpp16$FATALS <- as.factor(fcpp16$FATALS)

##### Using FSelectorRcpp #####

# Using all the variables before pre-process using FSelectorRcpp
```{r}

```{r}
#library(FSelectorRcpp)
x2 <- fcpp16
y2 <-  fcpp16$FATALS
information_gain(x=x2,y=y2)
```


##### Using FSelector #####

All variables fcpp
```{r}
#library(FSelector)
weights_fcpp <- information.gain(FATALS~., data = fcpp)
row.names(weights_fcpp)[order(weights_fcpp, decreasing = TRUE)]
```

Pre-processed variables fcpp16
```{r}

```


```{r}

```

```{r}
## Select top 15 variables

```

```{r}
## Select top 10 variables
subset_fcpp_10 <- cutoff.k(weights_fcpp, 10)
subset_fcpp_10
```

```{r}

# The random.forest.importance function is used to rate the importance of each feature in the classification of the outcome, chd. The function returns a data frame containing the name of each attribute and the importance value based on the mean decrease in accuracy.

```{R}
#library(ElemStatLearn)
#library(FSelector)

att.scores <- random.forest.importance(FATALS ~ ., fcpp16)
att.scores
```


#The FSelector package offers several functions to choose the best features using the importance values returned by random.forest.importance. 
# The cutoff.biggest.diff function automatically identifies the features which have a significantly higher importance value than other features. 
# cutoff.k provides the k features with the highest importance values. 
# Similarly, cutoff.k.percent returns k percent of the features with the highest importance values.
```{R}
f1 <- cutoff.biggest.diff(att.scores)
print(f1)
```

```{r}
f2 <- cutoff.k(att.scores, k = 15)
f2
```

```{r}
f3 <- cutoff.k.percent(att.scores, 0.4)
f3
```


```{r}
#library(FSelector)
weights <- gain.ratio(FATALS ~., fcpp16)
print(weights)
```

```{r}
weights = chi.squared(FATALS ~., fcpp16)
print(weights)
```




```{r}
result <- cfs(FATALS ~ ., fcpp16)
f_q <- as.simple.formula(result, "FATALS")
print(f_q)
```


```{r}
require(randomForest)
Y <- fcpp16$FATALS
fit=randomForest(factor(Y)~., data=fcpp16)
